    "top": "A charcoal gray cashmere blouse with oversized, ruffled sleeves adds a touch of romanticism to the otherwise minimalist ensemble. The blouse falls loosely around the body, creating a relaxed silhouette.",
    "bottom": "High-waisted black wool trousers with wide legs provide structure and a sophisticated feel.  The crisp lines of the trousers complement the soft draping of the blouse.",
    "shoes": "Black leather ballet flats in a pointed toe style add a touch of retro chic while remaining comfortable for walking.",
    "extras": "A long, ivory wool coat with a belted waist adds warmth and visual interest. Opt for a classic trench coat silhouette or choose a more dramatic peacoat style.  Complete the look with a simple silver pendant necklace on a fine chain.",
